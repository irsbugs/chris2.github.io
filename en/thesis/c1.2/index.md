## 1.2 Research Questions

When I first proposed my SWM idea as a PhD research project to my supervisors at our first face-to-face meeting, it soon became apparent that this research needed to go beyond simply the co-construction of a metacurriculum framework. It needed also to ask what might enable or constrain the wider acceptance in New Zealand education of such a metacurriculum and what strategies schools wanting to adopt an SWM in a diverse range of social structural and community contexts might realistically adopt. We agreed that an effective research design for this process of co-construction and consultation would be some form of modified Delphi survey of three or four rounds involving a panel of experienced secondary school teachers from a range of schools across the country. This led me to the following main research question and three related subquestions.

> What would enable secondary schools in Aotearoa New Zealand to establish a Sustainable Wellbeing centred Metacurriculum (SWM) for their years 11 to 13 students?

The overarching question is given operational direction by way of three sub-questions: 

1. What would/could a framework for an SWM co-constructed with teachers look like?
2. What links would/could teachers establish between the SWM framework, the New Zealand Curriculum learning areas, and National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) standards or other appropriate school leaver qualifications?
3. How can the uptake and development of the co-constructed SWM framework for years 11 to 13 students amongst Aotearoa New Zealand secondary schools best be enabled?
