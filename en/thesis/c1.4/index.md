## 1.4 the New Zealand education system

New Zealand's education system is decentralized, with the central government setting guidelines and providing funding, and educational institutions governing day-to-day operations. Schools are run locally by Boards of Trustees which are defined as Crown Entities with their responsibilities defined by by the Education and Training Act 2020. The administrative frameworks of most relevance to mainstream secondary schools are the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) (NZ Ministry of Education, 2007) and New Zealand’s National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA). The NZC has been described as *a document of two halves* (Hipkins et al., 2016, p. 147). The values, principles, and key competencies of the curriculum’s front half are strongly influenced by the holistic high-level aspirations of the Twenty-First Century future-focused trend within global education. The back half is oriented toward the traditional structure of K-13 education by learning areas, disciplines, and developmental levels. What the NZC does not do is show how teachers might weave the high-level aspirations of its front half into the subject-based achievement objectives outlined in its back half (Hipkins et al., 2016). This challenge to total curriculum coherence is characteristic of modern education systems globally, not just in New Zealand (Reimers & Chung, 2016) and is the reflection in education of the general trend toward polarization of holistic-synthesising from specialist-analysing worldviews. A polarization that makes the emergence of a convincing plan for a unified view of educational purpose, such as the SWM aspires to be, an existential necessity.
