<h3>1.3.1 Terminology <a id="1.3.1"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the Glossary section, I have listed the key acronyms used throughout the thesis. The meanings I associate with several key concepts are also important to establish clearly at the outset.</p>
<h3>1.3.2 <em>Sustainable Wellbeing</em> <a id="1.3.2"></a>
</h3>
<p>The meaning of the phrase <em>Sustainable Wellbeing</em> (SW) is discussed in Section 2.4.8 as it appears in the literature and Section 4.3.4 as it was interpreted by my research participants in the first round of my Delphi Survey. I use the phrase to describe a condition applicable to living systems in the most general sense possible. <em>Sustainable Wellbeing</em> includes the idea of a healthy birth and also dying well. It does not mean <em>living forever</em>. None of my participants interpreted the phrase in this way, but I make this point for clarity since that is one possible literal translation.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>Sustainable Wellbeing Metacurriculum</em> (SWM), as it appears in my main research question, refers to an idea about formal schooling which includes not only the design of curricula but also appropriate pedagogies, systems of assessment and qualification, the professional social structures of schooling and the physical, built and natural environments of schools. In short, it is a whole-school concept (Eames et al., 2013). The <em>SWM framework</em> of research subquestion 1, is more closely defined. It refers to the conceptual structure of levels, domains, and subdomains organising the Cross-Curricular Holistic (CCH) mode of the metacurriculum centred on Sustainable Wellbeing as a discipline in its own right, and also the emerging relationships of that discipline with the established disciplines of the Subject-Based Specialist (SBS) mode of the metacurriculum. Those relationships are the subject of my second research subquestion.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 Education for Sustainable Wellbeing EfSW and Climate Change Education <a id="1.3.3"></a>
</h3>
<p>In this thesis, I adopt the acronym EfSW for <em>Education for Sustainable Wellbeing</em> and position the SWM concept as its most effective form. EfSW has much in common with what has been termed Climate Change Education by other authors (Bolstad, 2020; Cheatham, 2022; Eilam, 2022; Everth et al., 2021b; Hackerott, 2021; Nagelhout, 2024; Will, 2023). Both emphasise the urgency with which Climate Change is constantly reminding us about the unsustainability of our global civilization and the inexorably increasing cost of ignoring it. Both emphasise that the drivers of, and remedies for, Climate Change involve not only physical processes and environmental resources, but also Social Justice, and Cultural transformation challenges. The co-construction of a Metacurriculum for EfSW which is the first outcome of this thesis, has not to my knowledge been attempted anywhere for Climate Change Education. In this thesis, I use the phrase <em>Climate Change</em> to refer to the physical climate phenomena associated with the dynamics of the complex adaptive solar-earth-human system as a whole. The causes and consequences arising from anthropogenically-driven Climate Change are symptomatic of, not equivalent to, our Sustainable Wellbeing crisis. I have opted for the phrase <em>Education for Sustainable Wellbeing</em> over <em>Climate Change education</em> because <em>Climate Change</em>, in my view, is associated in most people's minds primarily with this physical systems interpretation of the phrase rather than with its social and cultural determinants. Furthermore, <em>Climate Change Education</em> might suggest purely adaptive, fatalistic responses, to our Sustainable Wellbeing crisis, rather than including environmental, social and cultural mitigation strategies and the building of students' agency toward surmounting the Anthropocene challenge.</p>
<h3>1.3.4 Complexity <a id="1.3.4"></a>
</h3>
<p>Complex systems thinking is a foundational theoretical orientation for this research project. Complexity as a concept is referred to in the academic literature in many different ways reflecting the vast scope of its applicability. Likewise in this thesis, I have used a variety of phrases to emphasise this or that aspect of complexity as appropriate to the various contexts I address including complex systems theory, complexity theory, complex adaptive systems theory, complex systems dynamics, complexity thinking, and complex systems thinking. The main distinction among these terms for me is the inclusion of the words <em>theory</em> or <em>thinking</em> in the phrase. I use <em>theory</em> to refer to the work of scientists, and mathematicians to understand and model complexity, principally through the use of computer modelling and graphics. I use <em>thinking</em> in the phrase to express a more general and metaphorical use of the concept which includes complexity theory, but also a less precise, less restricted more metaphorical, and pandisciplinary appreciation of real-world complexity.</p>
<h3>1.3.5 The idea of a metacurriculum <a id="1.3.5"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the first round of my Delphi Survey, after asking my teacher participants for their views on Interdisciplinary and Disciplinary school and curriculum structures, I asked them how they understood the word <em>metacurriculum</em>. The most popular group of responses as I describe in Section 4.4.3 was ‚ÄúPandisciplinary‚Äù. This interpretation accords well with the provisional definition I gave them in the following section of the survey as my point of reference, before asking for their views on what Knowledge, Issues, and Big Ideas are most important to include in a Sustainable Wellbeing Metacurriculum for years 11 to 13 students. It stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my research I take the term <em>metacurriculum</em> to mean; some coherent construction of Interdisciplinary and Disciplinary education that connects all elements to a central organising ideal. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the various other meanings that the teachers suggested was <em>a curriculum about curricula</em>. This phrase neatly captures the self-referential meaning of meta‚Äîas in metacognition or metadata‚Äîand also the self-organising aspect of complex adaptive systems. One of the significant findings of this study has been the importance, for the success of an SWM, of engaging senior secondary school students in the design and evolution of the curriculum they are following, as integral to their education. The word metacurriculum, like the word <em>metadiscourse</em> (Davis &amp; Sumara, 2006, p. 7) should not be taken to mean a master curriculum of all conceivable knowledge, such as the elusive unified <em>theory of everything</em> physics seeks for instance, through the unification of general relativity with quantum mechanics. From the complexity theoretical perspective that I adopt in this thesis, reality is fundamentally irreducible and no such abstract theory of everything, apart from reality itself, exists. Nevertheless, a metacurriculum strives continually to include all worldviews and perspectives it encounters and to resolve any inconsistencies through creating a wider coherent synthesis.</p>
<h3>1.3.6 Business as Unsustainable <a id="1.3.6"></a>
</h3>
<p>Throughout the thesis, I have used the acronym BaU, commonly read as <em>Business as Usual</em> with a pejorative overtone, to refer to the traditional exclusively disciplinary approach to secondary school education. I ask the reader to instead interpret the phrase as meaning <em>Business As Unsustainable</em>. This study is about transforming society through education from a BaU to an SW worldview. <em>Business as Usual</em> in that context is problematic, since the goal is to reform <em>Business as Usual</em> so that it becomes Sustainable Wellbeing.</p>
