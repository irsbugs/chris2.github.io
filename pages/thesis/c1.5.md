## 1.5 Thesis structure preview

The thesis is organised into four main parts. Chapter Two reviews the relevant literature. Chapter Three outlines my methodology and research design. Chapters Four, Five and Six present the study findings, and Chapter Seven completes the thesis with a discussion of the most significant findings in relation to other relevant education literature, the limitations of the study and recommendations for policy, practice and further research.
