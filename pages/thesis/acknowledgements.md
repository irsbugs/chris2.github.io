Many people have helped me bring this thesis together, contributed to what it contains and supported it in spirit. To all of you my most sincere thanks. 

To my supervisors, Chris Eames and Bronwen Cowie, thank you for your inspiration, guidance, directness, humour, tact, patience, wisdom, warmth and unfailing encouragement throughout this five-year journey, for which I will be eternally grateful. Ngā mihi nui. 

I wish to acknowledge also the University of Waikato School of Graduate Research for its generous and vitally enabling scholarship support through the first three years of my PhD Study. 

To the twenty-three teachers who responded to my invitation to help me in the co-construction and evaluation of a Metacurriculum for Sustainable Wellbeing, my deepest appreciation. I hope you feel your views have been fairly and fruitfully represented in this thesis, that the time you so generously gave to this project was well-invested and that the study will make a useful contribution towards the vital work of better preparing our young people, through their schooling, to meet the challenges and opportunities they are facing in this time of the Anthropocene. 

To my PhD candidate colleagues Thomas, Thea and Ria, how fortuitous it was that we arrived at the same time and place on this mission of advancing Climate Change, Nature Connection, and Sustainable Wellbeing education. It has been so great to have journeyed with you, worked together and to have reinforced one another’s aspirations. 

To my dear family, Josie, River, Robyn, Carlo, Pete, Eva, Leo, Griffin, Solly and all the extended whanau thanks for your patience, and love, and for being there, especially at times of greatest need. Ultimately relationship makes our mahi meaningful. 

Sustainable Wellbeing to You All.
