## 2.7 Summary

*Sustainable Wellbeing* could be said to describe the principal objective of all creatures who have ever lived. There is an overwhelming accumulation of published evidence that humanity’s misapprehension of the necessary conditions for its Sustainable Wellbeing in its exponential ascendency to the position of a globally distributed apex predator has ushered in the Anthropocene epoch, or event (Randall, 2022), with multiple intersecting, self-inflicted, potentially unsurvivable threats to our Sustainable Wellbeing as a species. I have characterised our situation as one of lost connections with our natural, social and cultural environments, and argued that the cultural domain, through educational transformation, will have played a vital role if human beings manage to evolve beyond the Anthropocene. 

I have reviewed key insights from Complex Systems theory that I believe can facilitate the necessary educational transformation, including the concepts of Strange Attractors, Fractal self-similarity and the complementary nature of egalitarian-dynamic and hierarchical-dominance scale-free social networks. I have reviewed the various ways in which the concepts of Sustainability, Wellbeing, and Sustainable Wellbeing have been represented in the literature, with particular reference to Education for Sustainability and Wellbeing in the NZC and introduced the two levels of the Sustainable Wellbeing Metacurriculum framework with their three corresponding domains: Ecosphere, Social Justice, and Cultural Vision at the Human-Societal level; and Action, Feeling, and Thinking at the level of the Individual-Interpersonal, Integrating Self. 

Educational transformation is essentially socio-political in that it continually revisits the question of *what knowledge is of most worth?* (Spencer, 2009, p. 6). My thesis starts from the premise that knowledge of Sustainable Wellbeing, and how to attain it, is of most worth, but even amongst educators sympathetic to this premise there remains the vexed issue of whether a Cross-Curricular Holistic (CCH) or Subject-Based Specialist (SBS) pedagogical approach is more appropriate in the senior high school years. I have argued from the literature that for an SWM, both are required, providing they can be harmoniously combined to complement the strengths of one another. This a challenge the NZC and NCEA qualifications systems have yet to meet and New Zealand is not alone with this challenge. *The lack of an explicit and effective systems theory that supports an adequate implementation strategy* (Reimers & Chung, 2016, p. 239) for the goals of a twenty-first-century education, which includes future-focused CCH issues like Sustainable Wellbeing, has been identified as *a critical void in the research literature* (p. 239). It is a void that this research project sets out to help fill. 

I have set out the theoretical basis for an elaboration of the SWM framework levels and domains introduced in Section 2.4 which uses concepts inspired by complex systems theory, specifically the Triadic Sierpinski Fractal (TSF) model, to generate a starting point for a metacurriculum co-construction research design. This starting point *Minimal SWM framework*, including its approach to investigating CCH-SBS complementarity challenges and facilitating improved opportunities for dynamic-egalitarian teacher interdisciplinary networking is taken up in Section 3.5 within the next chapter which details the methodology for this study.
